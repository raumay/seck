Search Engine Construction Kit

version 0.0.2

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION

seck-lib -- library routines that are shared by both the backend applications and the web application

seck-app -- suite of backend applications that are responsible for crawling and indexing/archiving (cataloging) data 

seck-web -- servlet-based web application providing users with a browser interface access to the search engine data

ECLIPSE GUIDE

To develop the project in eclipse (this is assuming that you've correctly pulled or forked the project from the master branch):

1. Using maven to setup your eclipse settings in your top level directory:

   cd /path/to/seck/
   mvn install
   mvn eclipse:eclipse

2. Importing modules (projects) into eclipse:

   File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > [select path to sec-lib] 

Make sure that you do not check copy project into workspace as this will cause problems for synchronizing with GIT.

3. Repeat step #2 for sec-app and sec-web -- note that you ONLY need to import into eclipse and that you only need to run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' (step #1) once at the top level directory


SAMPLE APP

To compile/package the sample command line search program:

  cd /path/to/seck
  mvn package

To run

  cd /path/to/seck/seck-app/target/
  java -jar seck-app-0.0.2.jar /search/path "keyword"


TOMCAT

Tomcat is configured to run in place within the top level directory, to use it:

  cd /path/to/seck
  mvn tomcat:run

Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/seck-web/hello

If you want to use tomcat 6 (or 7):

  mvn tomcat6:run

You will notice that we now have a different port for tomcat 6 (and 7) and the top level directory is no longer seck-web

  http://localhost:9090/
