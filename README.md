## Eclipse Guide

To develop the project in eclipse (this is assuming that you've correctly pulled or forked the project from the development branch):

1. Using maven to setup your eclipse settings in your top level directory:

    cd /path/to/seck/
    mvn install
    mvn eclipse:eclipse



2. Importing modules (projects) into eclipse.  Make sure that you do not check copy project into workspace as this will cause problems for synchronizing with GIT.

   File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > [select path to sec-lib] 

3. Repeat step #2 for sec-app and sec-web -- note that you ONLY need to import into eclipse and that you only need to run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' (step #1) once at the top level directory.

## Sample App

To compile/package the sample command line search program:

    cd /path/to/seck
    mvn package

To run

    cd /path/to/seck/seck-app/target/
    java -jar seck-app-0.0.2.jar /search/path "keyword"


## Tomcat

Tomcat is configured to run in place within the top level directory, to use it:

    cd /path/to/seck
    mvn tomcat:run

Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/seck-web/hello

If you want to use tomcat 6 (or 7):

    mvn tomcat6:run

You will notice that we now have a different port for tomcat 6 (and 7) and the top level directory is no longer seck-web

    http://localhost:9090/
